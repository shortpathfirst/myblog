# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Notorious **NP-hard problem** and as such it does not have polynomial-time algorithms to find optimal solutions neither polynomial-time algorithm to verify such solution because the only way is to calculate it first.

# Modelling the problem
- Cities are enumerated 0,1,2,3.. etc
- Adding points to a canvas
- The resulting TSP is then calculated and displayed



|Algorithm|Complexity|Description|

|Brute force|  $ O(n!) $ | Try all permutation

|[Lin–Kernighan heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic)| O(n⌊p1/2⌋)| Local search|

|**Approximation** |
|Nearest Neighbour| linear with approx factor log\|V\|  | Greedy search
|Christofides-Serdyukov	| linear with approx factor 1,5| MST 
|Double Tree|linear| MST|

Here there's two different approach to get some solutions.
# 2-Approximation Algorithm
____
## Christofides' algorithm
This approach is known as the Christofides' algorithm, which guarantees an approximation within a factor of 1.5 of the optimal solution. Here’s how the algorithm works:

1. **Construct the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of the graph.
2. Find all vertices with an **odd degree** in the MST.
3. Find a minimum-weight perfect matching for the odd-degree vertices.
4. Add the edges of the matching to the MST, resulting in an Eulerian graph.
5. Convert the Eulerian circuit to a Hamiltonian circuit by skipping repeated nodes, resulting in an approximate TSP solution.
_________
>This solution attept to solve `Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)`, and it does so in a correct manner based on a widely-used **heuristic** known as the `Christofides algorithm`. While it doesn't always guarantee the optimal solution, it produces a good approximation in polynomial time.


1. The `PrimMST.js` code calculates a `Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)`, which ensures that all nodes are connected with the minimal total edge weight. The MST provides a lower bound for the TSP
2. The `EulerianPathFinder.js` takes the MST and transforms it into an Eulerian graph by doubling edges. Every node in an Eulerian graph has an even degree, allowing for the construction of an `Eulerian circuit` (a path that visits every edge at least once). 
3. The `geometricTSP` function then "shortcuts" the Eulerian path by removing visits to already-visited nodes, taking advantage of the triangular inequality.

|Each Node is a point in the cavas with (x,y) coordinates| MST calculated with Prim's Algorithm|An eulerian cycle that crosses every edge once is found|By the triangle inequality, the cost of the shortcut tour |
|The weights are the distance between the nodes|The graph distances are the lower bound for the TSP||is at most the cost of the Eulerian tour|


# Self Organized Map
>A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) representation of a higher-dimensional data set while preserving the topological structure of the data. 

 **Travelling Salesman** using Self Organized Maps
- you start with an arbitrary curve made up of many points 
- each iteration you move the curve closer to the points inserting all the nodes
- the polygonal curve self adjust to fit all the points with the minimum distance.
